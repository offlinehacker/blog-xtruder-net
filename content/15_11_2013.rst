- Song of the day `Skylar Grey - Coming Home <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRwELMBfeEI>`_

  My honney is reading my mind. Well i was searching for some songs and found
  this one and she also posted it on her fb profile.

**What's new?**

- I was sick yesterday...and basically i still am

  Looks like my kidneys got sick, it was rly bad pain, hopefully it's going to
  get better. I don't know if should i visit a doctor or not. Are these just
  common muscolo-physical problems i have or is it something more problematic?

- So much to do?

  Well yeah i have much work to do, my priority is college stuff i have, and i
  have not finished yet, but besides that many other things. I should go with
  profesors daughter to presentation of our project, but i have 1 hour of
  laboratory work on college and i doubt i even have will to go, i have done a
  lot for this project previous and this week already.

- A book

  I decided to write a book. I realized life is just too short not to write
  book about all things that make me who i am. The title is **So much more than
  love**, and it's about how the love changed me and learned me who i am all the
  good and bad things that happened.

  So one more thing is that i will probably drop hardcode programming for some
  time. It's just not worth it. First i have to find who i really am or this
  is just pointless.

**Tech:**

- Rapid miner?

  It turns out rapid miner software package for data mining can be usefull, but
  at the end turns out to be painfully slow. Well i converted statistics data
  from users solving exercises on euganke from json to xml(using yahoo yql) and
  imported that into rapidminer. It was just a table with around 2000 entries.
  Turns out that importing data was quite nice, since rapid miner supports
  xpath when importing xml data, and importer is quite nice. I was able to do
  xpath queries like `//a/b[key='id']/value`, so my data got nicely imported.
  I only had problems with importing iso formated date time, which native date_time
  type was not able to recognize, but i found date format option outside the
  import wizzard and changing format succesfully imported my iso formated date
  time.

- Teacher conference:

  I visited teacher conference on Bled with profesor and her daughter to
  present our new web and mobile application euganke. Well the interes was
  not big, but i didn't expect anything more.

- All the ways you can explain what nixos is:

  There wouldn't be a blog if i would not talk about nixos. Nixos is a magic
  linux distro that grows itself. Instead of bringing soil to grow your favourite
  distro like puppet, chef or other similar tools do, nixos distro is build on
  soil. It's like bonsai, but in linux world.

  So my question is? How do you(if you do) grow your distro?
